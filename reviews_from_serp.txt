Review: Tatte is a great chain.  Clean, predictable, well-staffed.  I met someone for breakfast at this Back Bay location.  Like any urban coffee shop, it suffers from laptop users monopolizing tables (limiting sitting options) while they nurse a single coffee.  However, I would highly recommend and would definitely go back.

Review: I came here for dessert with the family - don't bring the kids if they're hungry, they want everything! We got a raspberry cheesecake, coconut chocolate macaroon, strawberry rhubarb turnover, apple pie, and a chocolate rose. Normally I'd post pictures but these were loved and devoured so quickly. All were delicious and everyone picked their choice as a favorite making me think Tatte is great at what YOU like. I definitely recommend checking out for a sweet treat. The coffees and sandwiches looked good as well.

Review: Ok to take away. Horrible if you want to sit down in the tiny dirty tables within an overpacked place. Many people chatting over a small coffee while others waited to sit down to have lunch. I like the pastries so it is worth it for me to wait the long line, grab my coffee and pastry and head quickly to the park so that my senses can get over the madness of this place. I recommend the team to keep the tables for people eating food on plates (they have many savory dishes) and ask those wanting to have a small coffee and chat to take their coffee elsewhere.

Review: Oh I love Tatte.... I'm so glad to have this available at what feels like every corner as opposed to anti-union Starbucks. I don't recommend their black sesame latte but the normal one, the house latte, and their matcha are all good. Keep in mind that the sweetner/simple syrup as well as water and napkins are at a station(s) somewhere in another part of the room. The cheese boureka, the lamb sandwich, donut, and the brownie are so good.

Review: I stayed farther away from this Tatte location but made a trip to come back for breakfast because I had a good experience in the past.

Everything went well until. When I was 3/4 of the way through my lamb hash, I went to refill my plastic cup of water and when I came back a Tatte staff member was clearing my lamb hash. He did not take my latte thankfully. That is why I am giving it one star.

As I thought quickly about, I was able to get my plate back and finish my meal. I explained that he had taken my plate and he did not apologize. He did not say that he did anything wrong.

I understand mistakes are made and it was early on Sunday brunch but I wonder the balance of cleaning tables and letting people enjoy the their meals.

If the staff had even mildly acknowledged that it was not appropriate, I would not being writing this. I wanted to explain this to the manager after I ate my meal and it was going to be a further issues. I post it here for management to see and understand about the balance of having a high turnover place of customers.

Honestly, everything else was great there and the staff were super respectful. It was unfortunate that this was last experience for my breakfast.

Again I am a big fan of Tatte work but sharing this feedback for others to be aware.

Review: Excellent coffee and delicious food. I had the Balkan sandwich and it was well made and big enough to fill me for several hours. I also had soy latte and the coffee wasn't too intense (which I liked), very high quality and rich taste. My partner had the egg on the hole dish and it look very good, he loved it! Service was good (we did take away) and prices are between fair to little expensive.
I would recommend this place to for a brunch.

Review: Fantastic food but I ordered three things (that came from 3 prep areas) and 2 of the 3 were completely wrong (some kind of whoopie pie thing instead of a chocolate chip cookie, a coffee-based latte instead of a chai tea). The order was written correctly on the receipt so it’s strange two things were wrong. Anyway check your take out if you want what you ordered instead of chefs choice!

Our cashier was so patient with our family yesterday as we slowly picked out 6 different desserts. She was especially cool and collected when another customer stepped out of the line and then returned in the middle of my order, expecting to reclaim her place. Our cashier was gracious with all of us and everyone left happy. Oh, and the treats are to die for. Thanks y'all. Our kids will always remember Tatte. :)

Review: Tatte is a modern, cute, cozy cafe with an amazing selection or pastry, brunch and lunch options. The food was delicious; we tried the traditional shahshuka and the lamb hash dishes which were both delicious flavor wise. The only complaint was that the eggs were slightly undercooked (some of the white was still kind of runny). The coffee was a hit; we had the seasonal pistachio iced latte and a mocha iced latte which were delicious since they were made with actual ground up pistachio and chocolate respectively.

It can be a little tricky to find seating if you want to dine in since the place is extremely busy, but we would definitely pop back in here for a quick breakfast and coffee.

Review: Seriously the best pastries! I wish we had a Tatte in Chicago! This location was close to our hotel and we went here daily for breakfast.

Loved the pain au chocolat with the super generous Valrhona dark chocolate batons. Super fresh and flaky. The pistachio croissant was also equally flaky and had the just the right amount of perfectly sweetened pistachio filling. The dark cherries almond scones is also incredible! So good in fact, that I took one to go on the way to the airport.

As far as coffee, I am totally obsessed with the honey halva latte and the kobocha squash latte!

Wish I had more time in Boston because I would have loved to try the salads and sandwiches. Cannot wait to come back!

Review: Tatte is overhyped in our view. Everyone raved about it when we were visiting Boston, but their dishes are pretty basic (we had pancakes, scramble on sourdough and a BLT so boring we were confused if it actually meant Bland Light Toast). They can’t make coffee either, burning off two roasts before we gave up. It was nice and clean though, and this particular one was huge so there should generally be ample space (especially of the food/coffee is alwayd like this).

Review: This location is not allergy friendly!! Sad because this place has amazing food - and I have always enjoyed it. But when I went over the weekend I ordered the Prosciutto and Fried egg. I asked for it without egg because I can not eat it. It is made sunny side up so I could not have the yolk touch it. I wanted everything else that came on the toast (proscuitto/whipped feta/ pesto) but no egg on top.

At first I was told that was not an option. They had to include the egg or I could not get it. I then asked if they could put it on the side - I was told no. After I pushed back a little asking why- she grabbed her manager. Who said the same thing, that you can not alter the recipes for kitchen efficiency purposes. She then showed me the computer and said see no option without it.

Now I completely understand not being able to alter a recipe premade but I was just asking for the egg NOT to be included or put on the side. After some back and fourth the manager was able to make a note and they did put the egg on the side. But the whole thing felt a little unnecessary and uncomfortable. The server did apologize after. Just hopeful in the future they make it a little easier to remove stuff like that if someone needs it for whatever reason.

At the end of the day though the toast was AMAZING- as I knew it would be. And the pastries are always great.

Review: Excellent breakfast sandwich with incredible sourdough bread. Very fresh.  Best coffee I've had in a long time.  Crowded at 11:30 am, which we took as good sign, but very fast service.  Staff at pastry counter could use some training in customer service, or just plain manners.  As a 1st time guest, we were basically following the line and was rudely told this was "pastry line only"... so we moved the 2 ft to the "other" line, only to have her step over there to take our order... but food was really great comfort food as it stormed outside.  Want to go back for the same order this morning, only a 3 min walk from The Four Seasons.

The breads, pastries, mini cakes & tarts all looked so scrumptious, it was so hard to choose. Definitely want to come back here.

Review: Wow. Not a good experience here which I found surprising based on other reviews. We showed up close to closing but still we expect good service. We  ordered 2 coffees, neither were good we also ordered a tart a fruit that did not look fresh but tasted okay. To top it off one of the servers walk by us with his hands down his pants adjusting himself and no he didn't bother washing them. I don't think he even noticed us sitting there. Needless to say we were done.

Review: I was visiting Boston and we went to the bakery while shopping. The coffee was so good it marked my memory. I am not a coffee person, had one that day to keep me warm and save me from that cold weather. I had my friend drive me again for 20mns to have that coffee again before going back to FL. It's a must that I go there whenever I'm in Boston. Pastries were good too... I had the fruit tart, the chocolate lava (don't quite recall name) and the lemon dessert.

Review: I rarely write bad reviews because I prefer to support local businesses but this has to be said! The food was so greasy that we had to waste 50 Napkins in an effort to keep the coffee cup from slipping out of our hands. The coffee was stale and burnt and we arrived shortly after they opened so I'm pretty sure they didn't clean the pot first. The server that brought the food to the table was rude... and that's being polite!

Don't waste your time, better food is everywhere in Boston!

Review: Consistent poor service. The food is good, but everything is expensive. The food would be worth going in for if the rest of the experience wasn't so negative. They never seem to get my drink right no matter what I try. (And I order something easy like a cappuccino) Even if its right, i've waited at least 10-15 minutes with maybe one or two people ahead of me to get one drink. If you don't order it extra hot it will be cold from how long you've waited. I don't know if its just this Tatte location in particular, but the staff are not very friendly as well.

Review: Tatte was incredibly close to our hotel, so we walked there for our first breakfast in Boston. It was so good that we went back there for our second breakfast, AND we popped into their other location for an evening sweetie and coffee. The first visit we sat inside at the counter, but the second morning we scored an outdoor spot. If the weather is nice, I highly recommend it. Inside it's a bit crowded and it took a beat or two for us small-town folk to get the hang of the place. When you step inside there are several regulars who know just what they want. I recommend grabbing a menu off the counter and just stepping aside so you aren't hurried as you decide what to have. If all you want is bakery, you tell the first employee who asks you. If you're ordering off the menu, you make your way down to the checkout, place your order, and then you're given a number. Look for a spot to sit, or wait patiently for one to open. In this location I think the only thing that we questioned was the placement of where you pick up your drinks. The line forms right where the staff pick up the food that needs to be delivered, and it's right where the cream, sugar, etc. are located. A bit of a congestion spot, but not a deal breaker. When we stopped for the evening treat at the other location, Tatte was much quieter and we had time to really check out the offerings in the bakery cases.

Review: Great food with satisfying, complex textures and flavors! So much attention to detail here, which adds value and enjoyment. All the seasonal salads aren't just lettuce and vegetables, there's also fresh parsley and mint in there. Toasted nuts for crunch. And the grilled chicken on the side is served hot and cooked just right. All the dressings are interesting, complementary and perfectly seasoned. Detail adds value, I'm telling you. Nice to eat in relaxed setting on a real ceramic plate with metal knife and fork. Food comes out quick, too. Puts other bakery/cafe chains to shame.

Review: Always a great meal here.  Coffee is fantastic and so are the salads.  We each had the "Green & Nutty" salad.  A variety of greens, sunflower and black sesame seeds, pumpkin, apple, apricot, and goat cheese.  I added avocado and my partner added chicken.  The service was quick but clean-up a bit slow.  There were a few tables outside with dirty dishes from the time we arrived until we left.  I'm hoping management will see this and take note. however, I won't let it effect this rating.

Review: The place is lovely, nice selection of baked goods and the staff speaks Spanish so that's a plus!
I was however a bit disappointed by the service.
I paid for my latte and did not receive a printed receipt or any receipt at all, I told the lady at the register my name and waited in line to get my coffee. I waited TEN whole minutes in front of the counter, waiting for my name to get called and only after ten minutes of waiting the lady behind the bar acknowledge that maybe I had been waiting too long for my order. I had to go back to the register to ask for the lady to check again for my receipt and eventually it turned out that "somebody" had taken my coffee, even though I have a pretty unique name.
To cut it short I waited 15 minutes for an okay coffee. I really like Tatte but I don't think I will be coming back in this location.

Review: Happy with almost every experience I have had at these local eateries. My only issue is when paying the bill they offer preset tip amounts in 18% 20% and 22 or 25% options. For a place whose service is more serve your self and clear your own dishes this is a high percentage for recommendations. I’ll tip accordingly at almost every opportunity but this seams a little over the expectation of the service level provided. Just my opinion

Review: Had a pretty terrible experience here. My wife was experiencing mornings sickness and just wanted toast and bacon. I was going to order the salmon, egg, and avocado sandwich and coffee. When I asked for the toast and bacon, the checkout person said that it wasn't possible to order that and that I'd have to buy a full meal in order to get toast or bacon. I wasn't even able to order it as a side. We spoke to the manager as well and they were both fairly rude. I don't understand how it's possible to make both toast and bacon but be unable to sell it separately? We ended up walking away because of how rude they were and how unaccomadating they were for a pregnant woman.

Review: Very disappointed with the service though the
food was good. We ordered chocolate, butter,
pistachio croissants when they were still
available. One hour later we get two pistachio
croissants and an almond croissant with the
reason that they're out of butter croissants.
When asked about the chocolate croissant, they
said they would check and made us wait for
some more time. After all the wait, had to go in
and check on the order ourselves only to hear
the same old 'we are out of stock' story. They
didn't even have the courtesy to inform us. For a
place with such high ratings, it sure treated us
badly.

Review: It was my favorite bakery in Boston. Every time I travel in Boston from New York I always go there and purchase lots of bakeries for me and bring it to my friends in NYC. But I was so disappointed yesterday about Tatte so now I don’t know if I ever come back there. I’ve purchased several bakeries and the girl at the cashier put in in a bag but not in the box (as they always do). I’ve asked her for the box (because I had to bring it safely to NYC, I wouldn’t care otherwise) and she responded to me in such a rude manner with such attitude. Like I was asking something inappropriate! She was so angry. She didn’t want to give me that box and rudely yelled at me, “I don’t understand why do you need the box”! Is it a problem in this place to give a little paper box for the bakeries your loyal customer bought there? Is it a great customer service? I was in shock! I thought it is such a nice place with most delicious bakeries and customer service! But I have doubts after that situation. I always was telling and recommending this place to my friends, but I will not do that any more. I’m so frustrated.

Review: I'm only in Boston for a few days and I've already been here twice. I wish I could come for every meal! So far, I've had the crunchy halloumi salad, the traditional shakshuka, a pear muffin and coffee. Everything was delicious. I love the Israeli inspired cuisine in a modern bakery setting. It's been crowded both times I've come (Saturday + Sunday) but they were well staffed and got the food out to me quickly.  The service was friendly and efficient.

I do wish they relied less on plastics. For example, they had no house glasses out for water and the water dispenser wasn't high enough to fit a personal water bottle under. They just intended everyone to use a plastic cup.

I wasn’t very hungry but my girlfriend finished her sandwich, and about an hour later she began feeling ill during our day in the city. She was sick less than 3 hours later. This was no doubt an effect of the sandwich since we ate the same meals the past 24 hours and this was the only one different. Would not come again.

Review: Decent assortment of baked goods, nice atmosphere, iced water you can get yourself, and tasty stuff. But since they're in Boston expect a city sticker price for your food. My dissatisfaction lies in the fact that their signage states one price but after checkout the cost per item is at least 50 cents higher. This is even before tax is added in. It could be that the signs need updating. But even some handwritten post-it note would have been sufficient. That said, $8 (excluding tax) for a small cake is on the higher end of bakery costs for treats. For the price I'm largely underwhelmed.

Overall, if you go in with the mindset that it's going to cost $$ you'll have a good time. Typical baked goods, expected selection of coffees/drinks, and very limited indoor seating on a weekend.

Review: I came here a couple times in the course of a trip I took to Boston in the summer of ‘21. Since then I have longed it was in Denver, where I live.

Not only does Tatte have some of the best breakfast food for a fast casual restaurant; yet, I had the most interesting coffee concoction that I’ve been trying to remake since I had it. I believe it was a honey and coriander coffee—an odd but delicious impressionable drink I yearn for randomly.

Tatte is a must try, especially for breakfast.

Review: The taste, quality and variety of the food is 4-5 stars. But the customer experience is a 1, at best. Better management is needed during busy times. At lunch or anytime during the weekend, it’s impossible to eat inside unless you hover near someone waiting for them to leave. There are many people that are nursing a nearly empty cup of coffee or are having an extended chat with their friends well after their food is gone. They should have signs suggesting that people be thoughtful and help to free up tables when it’s busy. Also, it’s not right for them to allow the wait for tables to get that bad. Someone should be walking around helping to manage the crowd and discouraging some people from getting their order to dine in.

Review: I got two things , an almond croissant : tasted like it was locked in a box with smoked ham for a week, and also it was very dry
An almond latte : they used the wrong milk plus spelled my name wrong so when i asked if its mine or not they said “is that your name on it ? If not probably not,… “ of course it was mine , with the wrong name and milk which is fine but the lady with the glasses who makes the coffee was also super rude not trying to figure it out,saying she doesnt know what kind of milk is in there and acting totally like its not her problem and that I should ask the one who took my order , the one who after not getting my order correctly said “well its probably not yours then “ never be back

Review: Here all the time as it is very convenient for work. Usually a line. Bakery stuff is good but very expensive. Brunch food and shakshuka are excellent. The coffee is decent I just wish their espresso drinks were actually served warm... I constantly get lukewarm drinks.

Review: Visited Tatte bakery twice on my 2-day trip to Boston so you can imagine how it'd be. It's really good, and has lots of options available. I liked the chickpea fava plate and the heirloom tomatoes with pesto tartine. Do check it out if you are in Boston. Because of how good it is and popular too, always expect some waiting/queue.

Review: I wanted to like Tatte so bad.  The atmosphere is incredible and I know the food is amazing!  However, with an allergy to eggs, the menu has VERY few options for me.  The entire breakfast menu is egg related and was even told I could no order with a 'no egg' option :(

Review: Went in here to order breakfast take out for the first time and let me tell you that my experience there made it enough to never want to set foot at that cafe again. It was extremely disorganized and chaotic because I had received a text saying that my order was ready, but when I went in, the food wasn’t on the shelf. No one seemed to know where my order was, so I had to walk in circles asking different workers for my bag. What should have taken 2 minutes max, ended up being a 15-20 minute wait and this was just to figure out where my food was. I wasn’t the only one that went through this as other people were also there to pick up their orders and saying they received texts when their food wasn’t ready. They too, were dazed and confused as to where their food was.

Review: Hard pass. All the pastries we tried (e.g. monkey bread, scones, donut) were super dry and lacking flavor. We bought the almond cookies as gift, and those were good. It took awhile for our sandwiches to be made, and we watched as 3-4 different people ahead of us returning due to missing items. I don't understand the popularity.

Nice place to catch up with friends, go on a date, or hang out with the family. The atmosphere is the selling point. Not somewhere I'd visit for a special treat.

Review: I love this cafe. The atmosphere is beautiful -- everything is a clean, modern white and is complemented with a reclaimed wood center table. Gah it's so cozy when you first walk through the door. And the food!! I usually order the same thing at places, but here I've eaten my way around the menu. I highly recommend the hearty turkey B.L.A.T., the French toast at brunch, and the shakashuma with lamb meatballs. YUM.
The only thing that I'm not a fan of is the price of their desserts/pastries; I think they're a bit expensive, though they're delicious. But everything else is reasonably priced and it's such a fun place to hang out or work.

Had to go back on line to place another order because they were not listening for my order, instead, cashier was trying to get you to tip them. While waiting for the 2nd time, they were giving another customer an attitude because they had to correct her order as well.

Review: I have been to Tatte a number of times now and usually get the same thing.  The Halloumi salad.  It's fresh and light and delicious, I really recommend you try it.  The desserts there are really good as well and they will definitely tempt you as you wait in line with them all laid out in front of you.  Seating is a bit limited at lunch so make sure to grab a table as soon as you can, especially if you want to eat outside on a nice day.  Drinks come up at a separate counter and are not brought to the table, so be ready for that.

Everything I've had was good but it's definitely on the pricier side. Maybe a good option if you're looking to splurge, or you're treating someone not local on a tour of Boston.

Review: I work on Boylston Street in Boston and most days I order my lunch from Tatte Bakery. In general I stick to the salads. While the quality of the food is good what you get is massively inconsistent. Take for example the Green and Nutty Salad, some days it comes with dressing, some days the dressing is missing, some days there are pumpkin seeds, some days no pumpkin seed, some days there is goat cheese, some days no cheese. They seem to charge me the exact same amount regardless of what they feel like serving me. Irritating.

So we left a cash tip. We noticed the bill was pretty high and didn’t match with the prices. When we left we did the math and realized he actually added himself a tip! That’s illegal and he should be fired! Always ask for your receipt at this location!

Review: This crisp white cafe is simply lovely and its my favorite place for a latte or small meal in all of Boston.
The pear/prosciutto sandwich sounds peculiar and looks rather plain and brown, but it's spectacular. Savory yet subtly sweet. The [BLAT] is great, and you practically have to unhinge your mouth the sandwich is so thick haha
Their [chicken, kale & orange] and [green & nutty] salads are both fantastic.
I had never heard of [shakshuka], but it's kind of like a thick pasta sauce with extra veggies and meat. Loved that, too.
Their desserts, while a little on the pricier side, are great little treats. Even the tiny cookies at the register are worth adding now and then for as a "treat yo'self". I'm not much of a cheesecake person, I love how they put so much fresh fruit on their cheesecakes - the tartness of the berries really complement well.
I'm still working my way around the menu, but everything I've tried I've thoroughly enjoyed at Tatte :)

The food's stale and not very good here as well, so if dirty tables covered in used napkins and hearing other people's Facetime conversations while you're trying to eat isn't your thing, try one of the other dozen cafes on Boylston.

And I'm thankful for my friend Greg inviting me there after we did the video shoot and interview at public gardens October 25th 2022! I also look forward to getting together with my friend Greg who is like an agent to me whenever we do these book signing events haven't done one yet but looking forward to the first one and it will possibly be with his Pastor friend Mike who I thought was awesome! And Greg is a really good friend and I look forward to his input on the new business card that I feel God wants me to make not only of the book but the music links and other things that will really make it look attractive to those I can share it with!

Review: Tatte is my favorite place but definitely not Tatte at downtown! A waitress is waiting for you and as soon as you have your last bite they jump to take your plate and make you leave so next customer can sit! All they think is the turnover and not customer satisfaction. Even if you don't eat your food fast and have conversation with your friends they would interrupt you to ask if you are done or not. You can't even sit in peace for every 30 minutes at lunch time.

Review: After walking forever to what ended up being a terrible restaurant near downtown, we were starved and in a rush to get some good brunch food and COFFEE and really couldn’t find much on Newberry Street ...thankfully someone pointed us here! Food here was freaking awesome - including the coffee, which I’m very particular about!
The young woman helping us at the inside counter was also super friendly and patient - we had a lot of questions with the food including the BOUREKAS and she never made us feel rushed! Also I really appreciate that they are making people sit outside for Covid precautions ..they are a very clean restaurant and being very safe overall (thank you!).
Caveat - finding a table can be hard - it seemed like some people were sitting outside not really eating food or maybe holding tables before ordering food ..I don’t know what Tatte can do to mitigate this - I know it’s hard to manage in a rush and they have only so much space in what must be a very expensive location. Still giving it five stars because I also appreciated they weren’t rushing people away. And bc the food and service was so freaking awesome. Did I mention— The food is extremely well made and delicious 🤤!! Cheers 😊✌️

Review: I went there twice and First time I ordered a mocha, it was very bad compared to the price point of $5+ I can feel the quality of the coffee and the chocolate was pretty bad and it tasted rough.

Second time, I ordered large Americano. It came out super thin like I am having hot flavored water. When I pointed that out, the barista was bit rude trying to educate me on what is an americano telling me it’s a one shot espresso and hot water. I was like indeed, but if I asked and paid for a larger, am I just simply paying more for water! she said yes. Large and small has the same amount of espresso, which is pretty silly. My conclusion is it’s an overrated, over priced experience of a very bad quality coffee. Not going there again.

They have a really unique yet classic menu (for breakfast you can't go wrong with an egg sandwich) which caters to all tastes and price points! The food and coffee are always top quality, the staff is wonderful, and the aesthetic is clean and bright (get your instagrams ready!). Enjoy!

Review: Incredible desserts, great coffee, and a hip atmosphere make Tatte a lovely coffee shop to stop by. Typically busy and may be difficult to find seating for more than 2 during the mornings and afternoons. Evenings die down.

Try a pastry while you’re there!

Unique items that only a chef could create. Has a natural and wholesome vibe, plenty of seating in and out and a coffee bar.

Review: What a disaster! Came to Tatte to enjoy a nice afternoon. Got a coffee. It was filled that it spilled through the lid. Tried to pour it out only to burn my hand. Asked the worker to help me as the coffee was all over the table. This bright one asked me what she wanted her to do!!!!  What a waste of a coffee, money and time. Dunkin would have been better.

Review: Excellent coffee, but so-called pastries are best avoided. "Croissants" are not made of pastry, in fact, but bread: hard on the outside, soggy on the inside, flaky nowhere. Of course, expectations can never be high in the Land of Wonder Bread, but...in a major city like Boston, and at these prices, it seems reasonable to expect a croissant which is, in fact, a croissant, rather than bread shaped to resemble one.

Review: Love how they manage the Covid risk. One door to order (and only masked people are let in 4 at a time) and then a pickup area where they text you when your order is ready and shout your name. They also ask if you need silverware. I had the tuna and yoghurt sandwich. And it was delicious with a heaping stack of tuna salad on challah. Would recommend.

Review: Charming bakery - gives very European vibes and bonus point for calling a pain au chocolat a pain au chocolat and not a chocolate croissant.
Layout for ordering isn’t ideal (queuing for the pastries, then to pay, then to get your coffee). But the food is good and the atmosphere is jovial.
Also it’s pronounced Tatte like Latte ;-)

Review: I go to this location every single day for a cup of large hot matcha with half water/half almond milk. Always order the same thing. I have been liking this place a lot and bringing my boyfriend/friends there as well. Today I came for my matcha as well. But the cashier overheard me and placed an order for a small cup, not large. I wasn’t paying attention, of course. Then, when the barista gave me a small cup, I said that I had ordered a large one, there must be a mistake. She gave me that look ... as if I am a fraudster or something and told me that they have to upcharge me for a large cup. I had to go back to the register and pay .... 37 cents (it took a while for them to figure out how to process that payment btw). Yes, sounds like a right thing to do, but it did not feel right. I actually felt very-very offended. A. It is not my fault the cashier got my order wrong; B. I have been spending $5.35 every single day at this place and they could not let 37 cents go?!?! I worked in customer service before and I WOULD NEVER do something like this to a loyal customer. Now I have extremely unpleasant aftertaste.

Review: With the help of my girlfriend I finally limped my way in here at 704p on a Sunday. There were customers in there. Mind you the door was unlocked. Did I say I was limping. As soon as I got to the counter at 705p I was told by a petite female that... actually we were closed 5 minutes ago....I was speechless. My girlfriend looked at me for a few seconds, looked around the store, held my hand and helped me limp my way out. To say we were shocked would be an understatement. This was the most insensitive human being we've ever encountered and if this business looks to grow in future then customer reception needs to be looked at seriously. Needless to say with the help of my girlfriend I limped my business elsewhere and was welcomed with open arms. This Tatte Bakery location would eventually go on record as the WORST IN CUSTOMER SERVICE 🙁🙁🙁

Review: I waited literally 15 minutes for a cup of coffee which I never got.  I had to go back to the register and they said "well someone probably took yours and walked off with it."  Isn't that why I gave my name?  Not that I remember hearing another "Dylan" get called... regardless.  I paid $20 for a breakfast sandwich, a drip coffee, and an orange juice.  I got my money back for the coffee, needless to say.  By the time I got to my bacon, egg, and cheese it was cold (from waiting for my elusive coffee) and wasn't really anything to write home about.  My original plan was to get a pastry on the way out but was too put off by the rest of my experience.  Not going back there.

The so-called barista told me very rudely that I wasn't supposed to blow my nose inside.
His manner is an insult to your establishment.

I felt bad because they were clearly overwhelmed with online orders and falling behind, but the staff were clearly not trained to deal with the level of orders they were getting, and we waited 15 minutes for 2 coffees while the staff at the espresso machine bickered and tried to sort themselves out.

Tomorrow isn't promise to us because Tomorrow may never come and I will always be happy to see you because you are always nice to us and we are always happy to see you
I then said you know why I'm always happy to see you girls she said because we know you respect us and look in our eyes and you always are happy we here and we have a good guy who wants us to succeed in life
Then i said what's the second question
She turned her head and went hhhmmm

Review: The breakfast items are great. The pastries are even better. Staff is friendly and attentive.

Only downside is finding a seat, it took a while for table space to become available. It seems people linger long after they finish eating.
